<a href="http://groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a> is a general purpose language that runs on the top of the JVM, the Java Virtual Machine
that seems to allow developers to be a lot more productive than using Java.

My primary reasin for looking into it is that it is the language used for the <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> Pipelines.

<h2>Install Groovy</h2>

There are plenty of ways you can <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/documentation.html#gettingstarted">download and install Groovy</a>.
As I am trying it on Mac OSX and as I already use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> I just ran

<code>
brew install groovy
</code>

and it installed it for me.

<h2>The version of Groovy</h2>

Then I ran the following command to see which version o f Groovy do I have and on top of which version of the JVM it runs:

<code>
$ groovy -v

Groovy Version: 2.4.15 JVM: 1.8.0_60 Vendor: Oracle Corporation OS: Mac OS X
</code>

<h2>Hello World in Goovy</h2>

Unlike in Java there is not need for a lot of cermony. You can use the <hl>print</hl> function to
print a string to the screen. You can include <hl>\n</hl> to embed a newline character.
There is no need for semi-colon <hl>;</hl> at the end of the statement.

<include file="examples/groovy/hello_world.groovy">

<pre>
$ groovy hello_world.groovy
</pre>

Alternatively you can use the <hl>println</hl> function that will automatically
append a newline to the end of the output.

<include file="examples/groovy/hello_world_with_newline.groovy">

<h2>Read from STDIN in Groovy</h2>

Reading from the Standard Input, normally the keyboard, is also quite easy.

<hl>System.in</hl> represents the Standard Input channel.

<hl>def</hl> defines a variable name. There is no need to declare the type of the variable.

<hl>println</hl> only takes one argument, so instead of passing a list of values we use the <hl>+</hl>
operator to concatenate the values.

<include file="examples/groovy/input_from_stdin.groovy">

<h2>Read from Console in Groovy</h2>

A shorter alternative is to use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Console.html">Console</a> object, but rumors say that it might not work inside an IDE. It works when running in the terminal.

<include file="examples/groovy/input_from_console.groovy">

<h2>Converting string to Integer</h2>

When we read a value from the standard input it arrives as a string. It cannot be used in numerical operations
even if the input looks like a number.
In order to use it as a number we have to tell Groovy to treat it as a number. For example as an Integer.
That's what "as Integer" is for in the next example:

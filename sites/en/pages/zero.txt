This is the first post, but as with most of the programming languages we start to count from zero...

=abstract end

I should write something very deep here, after all I am starting a new site, and I am planning
to write about everything. Well, almost everything.

I used to write a lot on the <a href="http://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> and by today, it
attracts quite a few readers every day, but I wanted to extend the content to cover all kinds
of other languages and technologies. I was wondering if I should just add those articles
to the Perl Maven site, but in then end I think it would be better to have a site that does
not contain any programming language in its name.

Anywa, let's get started.

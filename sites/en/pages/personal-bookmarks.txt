=abstract start

The objective of this project is to provide a web application to store bookmarks.

=abstract end

Each entry has a
<ul>
  <li>URL</li>
  <li>A title that could be fetched from the web site or typed in manually.</li>
  <li>0 or more tags. Each tag can be a few words long.</li>
  <li>A short description.</li>
  <li>Private note. This comment should be never made public even if the entry is public.</li>
  <li>It should be either public - anyone can see it. Or private - only I can see it.</li>
  <li>Date when the item was added.</li>
  <li>Date when the item was last edited.</li>
</ul>


The most basic version can work without any authentication. Assuming it is working on
my own computer without external access. In this case the private/public question is not relevant.

An improved version can have an authentication part. It does not need a registration part as
it is a personal system. Only one person, the owner should be ableto add/edit/delete items.

The logged in user should be able to

<ul>
  <li>Add a new item</li>
  <li>Edit an exsting item</li>
  <li>Delete an existing item</li>
</ul>

The system should support "fully private" version. In this case we have a single user and all the
items are private. There is not even an option to set an item to be public.


A search form that allows the user to search based on tags and/or based on content of the title, the description or even the url.

If the site is in private mode then only the logged in user can search.

If the site is in public mode, then anyone can search, but private entries can be only found by the logged in user.
One must take care that even the autocomplete suggestion system (if there is one) won't suggest words or tags
from private entries as that can reveal information.

=abstract start

When reading data from a file or from other external resources, they always arrive in Ruby as a 
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html">String</a> object.

If we would like to use them as numbers we first need to convert them to numbers.

But which number?

=abstract end

The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html">String</a> objects in Ruby have several methods to convert
the string object into a number.

<ul>
  <li><hl>to_i</hl> will convert the String to an <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Integer.html">Integer</a>.</li>
  <li><hl>to_f</hl> will convert the String to an <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Float.html">Float</a>, a floating pont</li>
</ul>

Even though we are calling this applications <b>"Single Page Applications"</b>, because we let the browser talk to the server behind the
scenes, in the end in many application we'll have multiple "views". For example Gmail has the "list inbox" view and the "show single email" view
and probably a few other views.

<h2>Simple page with multiple tabs</h2>

This is probably the most simple implementation:

<try file="examples/angular/simple_pages.html">

We create a variable called <hl>page</hl> which is actually connectected to the <hl>$scope</hl>

Let's implement something slightly useful.

In this <a href="/exercises">exercise</a> we have a file called <hl>numbers.txt</hl> that has numbers in it.
Each line is a number.

Our aim is to add the numbers and print the result.

=abstract end

<include file="examples/data/numbers.txt">

Expected result is 126.

I might be missing the obvious, but I don't think the <hl>subprocess</hl> module has a method
that will capture the standard output, standard error, and the exit code of a subprocess in a single
call. It is not complex to write one and can be useful.

<h2>The code that captures theresults</h2>

<include file="examples/python/capture.py">


<h2>A sample external program</h2>

<include file="examples/python/run.py">

<h2>The results</h2>

<code>
out: 'Hello World!'
err: 'Welcome to the dark side!'
exit: 1
</code>

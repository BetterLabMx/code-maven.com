=abstract start

We talk a lot about creating high-quality (software) products or services, but it is not evan clear what do we mean by quality.
Maybe what we should really talk about is creating value. But to whom? To the client? To the shareholder? To the employees?

On this page I am collecting some concepts and links related to the subject. In time I hope this will be transformed
into something usable.

<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> is one of the leading Configuration Management systems.
It allows you to describe the expected state of your servers one-by-one or grouped by their task and then
it ensures all the servers are in the correct state only relying on standard ssh access.

No agent is required on the host. You only need to install Ansible on the computer(s) from which you wish to manage
your servers.

In this series we are going to look at various features of Ansible.

<h2>Installing Ansible</h2>

Before you can start using Ansible you need to install it on the management machine. Your notebook or some in-house
machine in the company. One thing you need to remember about security is that the user who can run ansible will have
virtually unlimited control of all your servers. So make sure the account that is set up to run ansible has adequate
authentication set up.

I am setting it up on my Macbook air in my own account. I am going to use my own public key to allow me access to the privileged
user on the servers. I'd better not share my private key with anyone then.

There are a number of ways to <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html">install Ansible</a>.

Ansible is written in Python and as I already have Python 3 installed on my machine I went with <hl>virtualenv</hl> and <hl>pip</hl> here.

<code>
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install ansible
</code>

After a while I had Ansible installed.

<code>
$ ansible --version
</code>

Shows the version number of Ansible. (I have 2.4.1.0) with some additional information.

<code>
$ ansible -h
</code>

provides help. It lists many of the parameters we can use with the <hl>ansible</hl> command.

More to come soon.

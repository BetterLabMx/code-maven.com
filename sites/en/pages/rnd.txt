This is a series of blog posts, interviews with Engineering managers at various hi-tech companies in Israel.
Inspired by the <a href="https://increment.com/development/what-its-like-to-be-a-developer-at/">What it is like to a developer at ...</a> 
that was mentioned on a recent <a href="http://www.reversim.com/2018/06/341-bumpers-48.html">episode of the Reversim podcast</a> (in Hebrew).

I am interested in the life of all the people in the Enginnering department: Developers, QA engineers, DevOps engineers, IT, etc.
Anyone who is related to the creation of value to the customers.

I am also very much interested in the practices and processes employed.

I think these issues can be interesting to all the engineers around the world.

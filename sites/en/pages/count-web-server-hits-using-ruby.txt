The <a href="/exercise-analyze-apache-log-file-count-localhost">exercise</a> was, that given a log file created by the Apache web server (or by any web server), to 
count how many hits arrived from each individual IP address.

=abstract end

Earlier we saw a solution in which we <a href="/analyze-apache-log-file-count-localhost-in-ruby">counted the number of hits to locl host vs any other address</a>.
That program already had the part that read the file line-by-line and extracted the IP address.

This time we just need to change the method of counting.

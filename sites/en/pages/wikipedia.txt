=abstract start

<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is great, especially if you speak one of the major languages.

Unfortunately there are many people who cannot read these major languages, and even if they can, it is much easer
to understand thing in their own mother tongue.

On the other hand I have encounterd many articles on Wikipedia that are available in one of the "smaller"
languages, but not in English. I belive making these available in English as well would be important.

I have a number of projects in mind trying to help people who would like to contribute to Wikipedia
locate areas with some "low hanging fruits". The first such project is locating all the articles
that are available in one language, but seeming not available in English. These articles have not link
to their English counterpart. This can be either just missing the link, or because there is no English translation.

If you'd like to help check out the articles.

If you can locate the English version of the article then click on the "Interwiki link editor" on the lefth-hand
side of the non-English article and add a link to the Engish version. Then go to the English article and add a link
in the other direction as well.
I am not sure, but I think the rest of the Interwiki links will be added automatically by a bot within a few days.

If there is no English counterpart for the article then start translating!

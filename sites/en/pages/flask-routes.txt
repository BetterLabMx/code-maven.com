<a href=/flask">Flask</a> allows you to have a very flexible mapping of URL pathes to function calls. Let's see what can
you do.

=abstract end

<include file="examples/flask/routes/app.py">

You can start the application by running

<code>
FLASK_APP=app FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code>

And then you can access it using some of the following URLs:

<code>
http://localhost:5000/
http://localhost:5000/some/path
http://localhost:5000/user/foobar
http://localhost:5000/user/          Not Found!
</code>

Feel free to try anything you like. Below you'll find the test cases that will help you see which
route matches which URLs.

A few notes:

<ul>
    <li>Simple &lt;varname&gt; captures anything except slashes.</li>
    <li><b>string</b> is the default prefix so we don't really need to include it. It captures everything except a slash <b>/</b></li>
    <li><b>int</b> accepts various <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Nd/list.htm">unicode digits</a> as well</li>
    <li><b>float</b> accpets a floating point numnber like 123.4, but it does not accept 1. or .1  or a simple integer like 42 without any dot.</li>
    <li><b>path</b> accepts any character, including slashes <b>/</b>.</li>
</ul>

You can use more than one placeholders in a route definition and you can even have fixed elements between the
placeholders, though I am not sure when would you want to have that.


<h2>Testing the routes</h2>

I've also included sample code that will test each one of the given routes.

<include file="examples/flask/routes/test_app.py">

As they are writtent these two files need to be in the same directory. You can cd in that directory on your terminal and
run:

<code>
pytest
</code>

If you run it with the <hl>-s</hl> flag then you'll also see the output from the <hl>print</hl> statements in the test
file.

<code>
pytest -s
</code>

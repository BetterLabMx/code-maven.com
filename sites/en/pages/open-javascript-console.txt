In this page I am collecting the ways you can open the JavaScript Console on various operating systems in various browsers.

=abstract end

If you'd like to try it, just use this example:

<try file="examples/js/console.html">

<h2>Open JavaScript Console of Chrome on OSX</h2>

Command-Option-J

<h2>Open JavaScript Console of Firefox on OSX</h2>

Command-Option-K

<h2>Open JavaScript Console of Opera on OSX</h2>

Command-Option-I   and the click on "Console"


Safari on OSX: 

first enabled the developer tools 
Safari Preference (or press Command ,)
Click on "Advanced" setting
Check the box of "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
as explained <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html">here</a>
Then Command-Option-C will open the console.


<h2>MS Windows</h2>


<h2>Linux</h2>

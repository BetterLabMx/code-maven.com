<a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is a JavaScript framework that enhances HTML.

Here you'll find a few simple examples using AngularJS.

For a better introduction I'd recomment the <a href="http://www.angularjsbook.com/">AngularJS Book</a> by Chris Smith.

=abstract end

In order to get started with AngularJS we need to have an HTML page with 3 things:

1) It needs to load the angular.js file from either the Google CDN or from some other source.
If you'd like to load it from Google CDN then put this in your HTML:

<code>
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.14/angular.js"></script>
</code>

You can also download the angular.js file, put it on your server and serve it from there:

<code>
<script src="angular.js"></script>
</code>


2) Add <hl>ng-app</hl> to one of the HTML elements in our page. Anything within this element will be seen
as part of our AngularJS code. We can add this to the <hl>body</hl> element as it has been done in our first example,
and the whole page will be considered as AngularJS.

3) Add an AnglarJS expression.
